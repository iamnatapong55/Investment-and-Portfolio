# Foundation of the Investment-and-Portfolio Analysis

This personal project is aimed to explore how Python can be applied in the world of Finance and solve portfolio optimization problems. In this project, I included calculating the return of a portfolio, the risk of a security, Portfolio Risk, the Expected Return of a Stock (CAPM) and forecasting Stock Prices Using Monte Carlo Simulation.

The art of finance isn’t about maximizing an investor’s returns in a year. It is about making informed decisions that consider both dimensions, risk and return, and optimizing the risk-return combination of an investment portfolio.
