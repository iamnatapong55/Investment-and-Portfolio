# Foundation of the Investment-and-Portfolio Analysis

This personal project is aimed to explore how Python can be applied in the world of Finance and solve portfolio optimization problems. In this project, I included some of the in-progress projects as follows: 

|  No. | Topic
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------|
|  1   | Calculating the return of a portfolio                 | 
|  2   | The risk of a security                                |
|  3   | Portfolio Risk                                        |
|  4   | The Expected Return of a Stock (CAPM)                 |
|  5.  | Forecasting Stock Prices Using Monte Carlo Simulation |



The art of finance isn’t about maximizing an investor’s returns in a year. It is about making informed decisions that consider both dimensions, risk and return, and optimizing the risk-return combination of an investment portfolio.

## Demonstration of a near real-time interactive stocks app using web scraping technique - Power BI

---

1) At the Yahoo Finance webpage, go to the target stock and choose the preferable options. Right click at the download button and select copy link address.
2) On Power BI, "Get Data" and select "Web" then paste the link address to download data.
3) Create a function from Advanced Editor.

4) Update the static part to function name. This will iterate the URL with different tickers from the imported files later.

5) Work on an excel spreadsheet to list all the interest stock symbols and import it into the Power BI.
6) Coonect the custom function with a list of stock tickers.
